## Introduction

Hello there! My name is Osmo, I'm a third-year bachelor student at Helsinki University. I'm majoring in linguistics, a programme that covers general linguistics, phonetics and language technology. My two minors are fennougristic studies and Russian language and literature. I am particularly interested in language change, historical linguistics, sociolinguistics and the conservation of endangered languages. I also regularly take courses in different languages.

I am originally from Hyvinkää, Finland but now live and study in Helsinki. In my free time I enjoy hiking, photography, graphic design and creative writing.
